# OpenJevSwift

[![CI](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Fixtures](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/fixtures.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/fixtures.yml) [![Documentation](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/actions/workflows/docs.yml)

A native Swift implementation of [OpenJev](https://github.com/razorback16/openjev), the open,
Jev-compatible "System One" decision server. Send it a state and typed questions (`noul`,
`choice`, `score`); it reads every answer from a model's probabilities rather than generating
text, so an answer cannot go off-schema: a noul's is the probability of yes, and a choice's or a
score's the probability of every option, with a confidence. One `openjev` binary serves
DiffusionGemma 26B-A4B or JevK5 on MLX, or Verdict or Laya on Core ML, on a Mac, with upstream's
exact wire API, so TypeSafe's SDKs work against it unchanged; the same libraries answer requests inside an
iPhone or Mac app.

OpenJevSwift is an independent project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by TypeSafe AI (the
makers of Jev), by Google DeepMind or NVIDIA (DiffusionGemma), or by the authors of the other
models it serves. Jev, TypeSafe, Gemma and other names are the property of their respective
owners.

## Quick start

On an Apple silicon Mac with macOS 15 or later, Xcode 27 and its Metal Toolchain component
([docs/development.md](docs/development.md) has the one-time install):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift.git
cd OpenJevSwift
swift build -c release --product openjev
.build/release/openjev serve --backend verdict
```

The first start downloads Verdict's converted Core ML package, tokenizer and calibrator (about
310 MB) into Application Support and checks each file's SHA-256; the server listens on
`127.0.0.1:8080` once the model has loaded and warmed up. From another terminal:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/systemone -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model":"jev-latest","state":"The deploy failed twice and the site is down.","questions":{"urgent":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Is this urgent?"}}}'
```

```json
{"model":"verdict-1.4","answers":{"urgent":{"type":"noul","noul":0.5910340547561646}},"usage":{"input_tokens":45,"output_tokens":0}}
```

`openjev decide` answers one request without a server and prints the bytes the server sends:

```bash
echo '{"model":"jev-latest","state":"The deploy failed twice and the site is down.","questions":{"urgent":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Is this urgent?"}}}' | .build/release/openjev decide --backend verdict
```

Ctrl-C stops the server gracefully. [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) covers the settings,
a launchd job, the logs and the exit statuses.

An app depends on a release and links `OpenJevCore` and the module of each backend it loads; the
DocC article "Making decisions in an app" loads the same models inside an app:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift.git", from: "0.1.0"),
```

## Requirements

| Backend | Model | Mac | Memory |
|---|---|---|---|
| `verdict` | `verdict-1.4`, 151M parameters, Core ML | Apple silicon, macOS 15 or later | 1.6 GB with the functions one-question reads load, 2.8 GB with all six |
| `laya` | `laya-1.0`, 421M parameters, Core ML | Apple silicon, macOS 15 or later | 4.7 GB with the functions one-question reads load, 8.9 GB with all eight and up to 9.7 GB at peak; with `OPENJEV_ENCODER_FUNCTIONS=2`, 2.1 GB for one-question reads and up to 4.4 GB at peak |
| `mlx` | `openjev-0.1`, DiffusionGemma 26B-A4B, 4-bit, MLX | Apple silicon | about 17 GB to load, the vision tower's 1.06 GiB included (D-054); 17.3 GiB in service with short prompts, measured before the tower loaded, and up to about 3.6 GB more for cached long prompts; 32 GB or more recommended |
| `jevk5` | `jevk5-0.2`, JevK5 (Qwen3.5-4B), 8-bit, MLX | Apple silicon | 6.0 GB once loaded, up to 11.0 GB in service with `OPENJEV_MLX_CACHE_LIMIT_GB=4`; 3.6 and 8.9 GB with the 4-bit conversion |

Building needs Xcode 26.4 or later. The `mlx` backend also needs MLX's Metal shaders, which Swift
Build compiles with the Metal Toolchain: Swift Build is the default with Xcode 27, and Xcode 26
takes `--build-system swiftbuild`. In an app, `OpenJevCore` runs on macOS 14 and
iOS 17 or later, the Verdict and Laya backends on macOS 15 and iOS 18 or later, and JevK5 on
Apple silicon (it builds for iOS; it has not run on an iPhone yet). Linux builds the
core, the server and the `openjev` tool for the tests, without any backend.

## Status

Release 0.1.0 is the first version a package can depend on; [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lists
what it ships. Milestones 0 to 5 are complete, every work issue in them closed: the foundations,
the decision engine core, DiffusionGemma reads on MLX, the Jev-compatible HTTP server with the
`openjev` tool, the read extensions and images, and text generation with `think` and chat
completions (#50 to #53). `steps`, `samples` and `sequential` are verified end to end on
the DiffusionGemma checkpoint (#43, #44 and #45), and images are read on it, matching upstream's
image reads bit for bit on the oracle's kernels (#46 to #48). Verdict and Laya, from milestone 6,
and from milestone 7 the JevBench comparison with upstream and DiffusionGemma's calibration report
(#61 and #62), are done too. JevK5 (#55), also from milestone 6, is served, and gives its author's
published top answer on 230 of JevBench's 231 items (D-052).

Not there yet:

- The CLM model, deferred until someone asks for it
  ([D-011](docs/06-decisions.md#d-011-encoder-models-core-ml-for-verdict-and-laya-jevk5-first-among-the-extra-models)).
  If you need it, open an [issue](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/issues) or a
  [Discussions](https://github.com/Algorythm-Canada/OpenJevSwift/discussions) post with your use
  case.
- Release 0.1.0, with a version tag a package can depend on: #65.

[docs/08-implementation-plan.md](docs/08-implementation-plan.md) has the milestones and the issue
index.

## Compatibility

Apart from the recorded differences, everything up to the model's probabilities is upstream's byte
for byte: the prompts, the answer templates, the canvases and seeds, the request validation, the
error bodies, the headers and the `/v1/models` listing, all checked against fixtures upstream's own
code writes. The probabilities agree within measured bounds: DiffusionGemma's within decisions
D-014's and D-048's on the 63 oracle reads (the top label on 91.7% of slots, and on 139 of the 140
where mlx-vlm's top two are at least 0.5 apart), and between the two servers on 333 JevBench and
TypeSafe items; Verdict's and Laya's with upstream's top answer on all 666 items; JevK5's, on its
8-bit conversion, with its author's published top answer on 230 of JevBench's 231 items and the same
token counts on all of them. The differences, among them a stricter JSON parser, the 503 for any
backend failure and the features not built yet, each have a decision record.
[docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md) has the three tables and the matrix of what runs on
macOS, iOS and Linux.
